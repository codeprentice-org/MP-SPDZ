## Package Overview
mp-tensorflow is a package for secure tensorflow inference that utilizes the MP-SPDZ framework. 
For all supported models, computation are preformed in four parts:
1. Pretrained model is downloaded
2. Resource/Dependency collection 
3. Data processing
4. MP-SPDZ compilation

### Resource/Dependency Collection 
Add support for:
- [ ] Image metadata collection
- [ ] Tensorflow graph metadata collection

### Data Processing
